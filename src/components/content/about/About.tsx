                                    can do different types of code testing and prefer to code longer but with better
                                    quality. You may find some of my projects in this portfolio.

                                    problems, to craft solid and scalable frontend products with great user experiences,
                                    always pushing my own boundaries and allowing myself to think out of the box.
